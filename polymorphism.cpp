/*
polymorphism- many forms
one name multiple forms
eg. function overloading

compiletime polymorphism-(object is bounded to function during compiletime,early binding,static
                            binding),function overloading,operator overloading,
runtime polymorphism-(using virtual functions,late binding,dynamic binding) function call 
                        is not binded until runtime.
                        it is decided based on the datatype of the pointer that it is being
                        called on.
